Kay Framework
=============

What's this
-----------

Kay is a web framework completely specialising on Google App
Engine. But basic design is based on the Django framework, like
middleware, settings and pluggable application, etc. Kay uses Werkzeug
as lower level framework, uses Jinja2 as template engine, uses babel
for handling language translations. This software is distributed under
BSD license. See LICENSE for the details.


The software that Kay bundles
-----------------------------
* babel
* jinja2
* simplejson
* werkzeug
* pytz

Dependencies
------------
* Google App Engine SDK

  Plase create google_appengine symlink /usr/local/google_appengine.
  
.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo ln -s /some/whare/google_appengine /usr/local/google_appengine    


Quick Start
-----------

* First, copy whole kay directory with your project name, and cd into
  it.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cp -r kay yourproject
   $ cd yourproject

* Second, you can create your first application with following command.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python manage.py startapp hello
   $ vi urls.py
   $ vi settings.py

There is a sample urls.py in the file hello/urls.py as a comment. You
have to add 'hello' to the INSTALLED_APPS tupple in the settings.py.


* You can handle i18n like following.

.. code-block:: console

   $ scripts/extract-messages hello
   $ scripts/add-translation --app hello ja
   $ vi hello/i18n/ja/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
   $ scripts/compile-translations hello

You can also merge newly added catalogue into your translations as
follows.

.. code-block:: console

   $ scripts/extract-messages hello
   $ scripts/update-translation -l ja hello
   $ vi hello/i18n/ja/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
   $ scripts/compile-translations hello


* You must use GAE models directly. You can use kay.utils.forms for
  form handling. You can construct a form automatically from the model
  difinition with kay.utils.forms.modelform.ModelForm.
